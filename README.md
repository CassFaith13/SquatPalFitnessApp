<h2>About</h2>
This project was created to complete the Red Badge Final for Eleven Fifty Academy. The assignment for this project was to build an n-tiered .NET Web Application. I chose a Blazor Server for my web app. This was a great learning experience building something I chose and enjoyed doing.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
The requirements for this project were to create an application with a minumum of three data tables and two foreign key relationships. We had to fill out a Planning Document to detail the work we would perform prior to starting the project. There are many rubric requirements for the code including front end, back end, and database structure.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- I learned how to plan and build an entire functioning app on my own
- Time Management was very important
- Giving myself breaks when I became stuck 
- Reaching out for help earlier in the project
- There are so many ways to fix a problem

Unfortunately I was unable to get my authorization and azure deployment developed in time. This was an important lesson for me to allow for more time for these type of codes. 

<h2>Installation</h2>

1. Copy the web URL
2. Type git clone into your terminal followed by the copied URL
3. Enjoy!
